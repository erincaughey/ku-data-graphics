set up data: 
```{r import and clean}
country_trust <- read_csv("data/clean_country-fake-news-concern.csv")

country_trust_stack <- country_trust %>% select(country, somewhat_concered, total_concerned, total_not_concerned) %>% gather(concern, percent, somewhat_concered, total_concerned, total_not_concerned)

just_US <- country_trust_stack %>% filter(country == "US")

Small multiples to look at: 
Q_FAKE_NEWS_2_6. To what extent, if at all, are you concerned about the following: - The use of the term fake news (e.g. by politicians, others) to discredit news media they donâ€™t like

test plot with USA: 

```{r single plot}
US_trust <- ggplot(just_US, aes(reorder(concern, percent), percent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Level of concern over the term fake news in each country surveyed", y = "level of concern", x = "percent", caption = "Source: Reuters 2018 Digital News Report") +
  #facet_wrap(~ country) + 
  theme_minimal()

US_trust
```

small multiples: 

```{r small multiiples}

all_countries <- ggplot(country_trust_stack, aes(reorder(concern, percent), percent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Level of concern over the term fake news in each country surveyed", y = "level of concern", x = "percent", caption = "Source: Reuters 2018 Digital News Report") +
  facet_wrap(~ country) + 
  theme_minimal()
